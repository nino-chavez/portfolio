# Product Roadmap

## Implementation Status

> **Project Status:** 11 of 12 features complete (92%)
> **Last Updated:** 2025-10-14
> **Current Focus:** SEO enhancement and JSON-LD schema implementation

1. [x] Core Layout & Navigation Foundation — Implement single-page layout with smooth scroll navigation, section routing, and mobile-responsive grid system that serves as the foundation for all features `M` ✅

2. [x] Camera Metaphor UI System — Build reusable camera-themed components (viewfinder overlays, scroll-based camera controls, dial displays) with consistent visual language and interaction patterns across all sections `L` ✅

3. [x] 3D Canvas Spatial System — Develop coordinate-based canvas layout with camera controller, spatial sections, and transform system that enables innovative scroll-based navigation through 3D space `L` ✅

4. [x] Professional Content Sections — Create hero section, about/expertise section, and portfolio highlights section with copywriting that establishes credibility for all three target audiences (tech leaders, collaborators, photography clients) `M` ✅

5. [x] Photography Gallery with EXIF — Build filterable photo gallery with lightbox view, EXIF metadata overlay system, and optimized image loading that showcases action sports photography professionally `L` ✅

6. [x] Accessibility Implementation — Achieve WCAG 2.2 AA compliance through keyboard navigation system, ARIA labels, focus management, skip links, and screen reader optimization across all interactive elements `M` ✅

7. [x] Animation & Transition Polish — Implement Framer Motion-based section transitions, parallax effects, staggered reveals, and scroll-triggered animations that feel premium while maintaining 60fps performance `M` ✅

8. [x] Performance Optimization — Optimize Core Web Vitals through code splitting, lazy loading, image optimization, bundle analysis, and lighthouse-based performance budgets `S` ✅

9. [ ] SSR & SEO Enhancement — Configure Vite SSR with Express server, implement JSON-LD schema markup, optimize meta tags, and ensure proper social media preview generation `M` ⚠️ **In Progress**
   - ✅ Vite SSR manifest generated
   - ✅ Express server capability configured
   - ✅ Static deployment optimized
   - ⏳ JSON-LD schema markup (needs verification/completion)

10. [x] Cross-Browser Testing & Polish — Test and fix issues across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge; optimize touch interactions for mobile; ensure consistent experience across viewport sizes `S` ✅

11. [x] Quality Assurance & Monitoring — Set up Playwright E2E tests, Vitest unit tests, Storybook component documentation, and health monitoring system to ensure production readiness `M` ✅

12. [x] Deployment & Launch — Configure Vercel deployment for static site with edge functions, set up Express SSR capability for local testing, implement CI/CD pipeline, and prepare launch checklist `S` ✅

> Notes
>
> - Roadmap assumes existing React/Vite project structure is already in place
> - Items ordered by technical dependencies: layout foundation before advanced features, core components before polish
> - Each item represents a complete, testable feature spanning frontend implementation and user-facing functionality
> - Focus is on achieving the mission: establishing professional credibility through a sophisticated, accessible launch pad
> - Canvas system (item 3) is the most technically complex but unlocks the unique spatial navigation differentiator
> - Accessibility (item 6) is intentionally mid-roadmap to ensure it's built into features rather than retrofitted
> - Performance and SSR (items 8-9) come after core features are stable to avoid premature optimization
