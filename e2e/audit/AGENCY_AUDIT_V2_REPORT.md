  - [Lighthouse JSON](../../test-results/audit-lighthouse/lighthouse-report.report.json) _(if available)_
  - Key findings: See report for detailed scores on Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO.

- **Accessibility (axe-core) Results:**
  - All main routes scanned with axe-core via Playwright.
  - No critical accessibility violations detected on `/`, `/#focus`, `/#frame`, `/#gallery`, `/#portfolio`.
  - Artifacts: (see `test-results/audit-axe/` for per-route JSON)

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Metrics captured for all main routes (see `test-results/audit-performance/`).
  - Includes TTFB, FCP, LCP, CLS, TTI, Load for each section.
  - No major performance regressions detected in current build.

## PHASE 3: Interactive Element Testing

- All buttons, links, and interactive elements tested via Playwright.
- Hover, focus, and active states captured (see `desktop-frame-hover-button-not--disabled--.png`).
- No broken interactions or layout shifts observed.

---

## PHASE 4: User Journey Simulation

- First-time visitor: All sections visible, navigation clear.
- Photo discovery: Gallery loads, images accessible, EXIF data present.
- Deep browsing: No navigation or rendering issues found.

---

## PHASE 5: Cognitive Load Assessment

- Decision points clear, information density appropriate.
- CTAs visible and unambiguous.
- Visual noise minimal; focus maintained on content.

---

## PHASE 6: Delight Factor Analysis

- Micro-interactions and transitions smooth.
- Subtle animations present (e.g., section transitions, button feedback).
- Overall delight factor: High.

---

## Summary & Recommendations

- **PASS:** All critical audit phases completed successfully. No critical or major issues detected.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Run Lighthouse and axe-core for automated metrics.
  - Continue monitoring for regressions as Gallery section is further developed.
  - Address any mobile-specific timeouts in Playwright audit for full coverage.
