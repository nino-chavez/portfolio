### Short Term
1. Establish screenshot baseline for regression testing
2. Run all 3 audience journeys weekly
3. Integrate into CI/CD pipeline
4. Address TypeScript errors in non-critical files

### Long Term
1. Automate visual diff (pixelmatch)
2. Create visual-validator agent
3. Add Lighthouse CI integration
4. Build validation dashboard
