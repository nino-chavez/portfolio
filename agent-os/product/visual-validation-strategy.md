# Visual Validation Strategy

> **Purpose:** Confirm implementation status through functional validation, not just code analysis
> **Last Updated:** 2025-10-14
> **Owner:** Product validation workflow

## Problem Statement

Code analysis alone cannot validate:
- **User Intent:** Does the feature solve the user's problem?
- **User Journey:** Can users actually complete their goals?
- **Visual Quality:** Does it look and feel professional?
- **Functional Completeness:** Are all interactions working as designed?

We need a systematic way to visually and functionally validate each roadmap feature against acceptance criteria.

## Validation Framework

### Three-Layer Validation

1. **Code Validation** (Automated)
   - Component exists in codebase
   - Tests passing
   - No TypeScript errors

2. **Visual Validation** (Screenshot-based)
   - Component renders correctly
   - Responsive across viewports
   - Visual regression detection

3. **Functional Validation** (User journey testing)
   - User can complete intended actions
   - Interactions work as designed
   - Meets acceptance criteria

## Implementation Status: Current vs. Needed

### ✅ What We Have

- **Screenshot Infrastructure:** Playwright config with screenshot capture
- **Existing Flows:** 5 user journey flows already defined
  - `accessibility-flow.spec.ts`
  - `canvas-flow.spec.ts`
  - `gallery-flow.spec.ts`
  - `game-flow-sections.spec.ts`
  - `navigation-flow.spec.ts`
- **Component Capture:** `capture-components.spec.ts`
- **NPM Scripts:** `npm run capture:all`, `npm run capture:flows`, `npm run capture:components`

### ⚠️ What We Need

1. **Roadmap-to-Flow Mapping:** Link each roadmap item to validation flows
2. **Acceptance Criteria:** Define success criteria for each feature
3. **Visual Baseline:** Establish "correct" screenshots for regression testing
4. **Validation Checklist:** Systematic review process
5. **User Journey Scenarios:** Test from user perspective for each audience

## Validation Workflows

### 1. Manual Visual Review Workflow

**When to Run:** After implementing any roadmap feature

```bash
# 1. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Capture screenshots
npm run capture:all

# 3. Manual review
# - Open tests/screenshots/output/
# - Review each screenshot
# - Compare against design/previous version
# - Check for visual regressions

# 4. Check acceptance criteria
# - Open validation checklist for feature
# - Test each criterion manually
# - Document any failures
```

### 2. Automated Screenshot Regression

**When to Run:** On every PR, before merge

```bash
# 1. Capture baseline (main branch)
git checkout main
npm run capture:all
mv tests/screenshots/output tests/screenshots/baseline

# 2. Capture current (feature branch)
git checkout feature-branch
npm run capture:all

# 3. Compare (manual for now, can automate with pixelmatch)
# Visual diff between baseline/ and output/
```

### 3. User Journey Validation

**When to Run:** Before marking feature complete

For each target audience:

**Tech Decision Maker Journey:**
1. Land on homepage
2. Scan hero for credibility signals
3. Review technical expertise sections
4. Check GitHub/portfolio links
5. Find contact information
6. Decision: Reach out or move on

**Technical Collaborator Journey:**
1. Land on homepage
2. Navigate to architecture/expertise content
3. Review technical depth
4. Check for collaboration signals
5. Assess compatibility
6. Find connection options

**Action Sports Client Journey:**
1. Land on homepage
2. Navigate to photography gallery
3. Review image quality
4. Check EXIF metadata (technical skill indicator)
5. Assess style fit
6. Find booking/contact info

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Verification

For each roadmap feature:
1. Open feature validation section above
2. Test each functional criterion
3. Check acceptance criteria
4. Document pass/fail
5. Create issues for failures
6. Update roadmap.md with findings

## Integration with Agent OS

### Automated Validation Agent (Future)

```yaml
agent: visual-validator
triggers:
  - On PR creation
  - On feature completion claim
  - Manual: "validate feature X"

workflow:
  1. Run screenshot capture
  2. Compare against baseline
  3. Execute user journey tests
  4. Check acceptance criteria
  5. Generate validation report
  6. Update roadmap.md with results
```

### Quality Gate: Visual Validation

Add to `.claude/agents/` as `visual-validator.md`:
- Blocks PR merge if screenshots show regressions
- Requires acceptance criteria sign-off
- Generates visual diff reports
